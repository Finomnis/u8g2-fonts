- Vertical font position (like in u8g2, called font_calc_vref)
- Add unicode retrieval

- FontRenderer::get_text_dimensions
- FontRenderer::render_text_aligned
   - Problems: Where is the 'center' of the vertical alignment?
               Where is the max/min? Should they depend on the actual letters? (Would make the entire text move vertically if a character changes)

- Newline handling - especially with alignment
   - total alignment vs text alignment

- Rotation (like in u8g2)
- Do font generation check in CI
