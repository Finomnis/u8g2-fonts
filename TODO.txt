- FontRenderer::get_glyph_dimensions
- FontRenderer::get_text_dimensions
- FontRenderer::get_text_aligned_dimensions
- FontRenderer::render_text_aligned
   - Problems: Where is the 'center' of the vertical alignment?
               Where is the max/min? Should they depend on the actual letters? (Would make the entire text move vertically if a character changes)

- Newline handling - especially with alignment
   - total alignment vs text alignment

- Create a big test case with all possible (multiline!) alignments in one image
    (topleft, topmid, topright, midleft, midmid, etc)

- Do font generation check in CI


Maybe later, if requested:
- Rotation (like in u8g2)
